üîç **Overview**  
This project explores how to perform **monthly sales trend analysis using SQL queries in PostgreSQL**. The analysis includes revenue aggregation, order volume computation, and top month filtering using `EXTRACT`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY`.

üìä **Dataset Structure**

| Column      | Data Type      | Description                 |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| order_id    | SERIAL         | Unique Order ID             |
| order_date  | DATE           | Date of the order           |
| amount      | NUMERIC(10,2)  | Revenue from the order      |
| product_id  | INT            | ID of the product sold      |
